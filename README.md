# stablepy

**Description:**

The goal of this project is to make Stable Diffusion more accessible, simple and easy-to-use with python.  Stablepy is constructed on top of the Diffusers library

**Installation:**
```
pip install stablepy==0.6.2
```

**Usage:**

To use the project, simply create a new instance of the `Model_Diffusers` class. This class takes several arguments, including the path to the Stable Diffusion model file and the task name.

Once you have created a new instance of the `Model_Diffusers` class, you can call the `model()` method to generate an image. The `model()` method takes several arguments, including the prompt, the number of steps, the guidance scale, the sampler, the image width, the image height, the path to the upscaler model (if using), etc.

**Interactive tutorial:**

**Examples:**

The following code examples show how to use the project to generate a text-to-image and a ControlNet diffusion:

```python
from stablepy import Model_Diffusers

# Generate a text-to-image diffusion
model = Model_Diffusers(
    base_model_id='./models/toonyou_beta6.safetensors',
    task_name= 'txt2img',
)

image, info_image = model(
    prompt='highly detailed portrait of an underwater city, with towering spires and domes rising up from the ocean floor',
    num_steps = 30,
    guidance_scale = 7.5,
    sampler = "DPM++ 2M",
    img_width = 512,
    img_height = 1024,
    upscaler_model_path = "./upscaler/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth",

    prompt='highly detailed portrait of an underwater city, with towering spires and domes rising up from the ocean floor',
    num_steps = 30,
    image = "./examples/image001.png",
    image_resolution = 768, # Maximum resolution scaled while maintaining proportions based on original dimensions
    preprocessor_name = "Canny",
    guidance_scale = 7.5,
    seed = 567,
    FreeU = True,
    lora_A = "./loras/lora14552.safetensors",
    lora_scale_A = 0.8,
